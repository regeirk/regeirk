### Hi there 👋

I’m Sebastian — I solve complex problems using data, algorithms, and a blend of technical expertise, analytical thinking, and intuition. Whether improving existing systems or developing new solutions, I approach every challenge with curiosity, creativity, and precision.

I thrive when learning new skills that align with my values and prefer solving problems through sustainable, well-founded practices rather than quick fixes. I don’t do my best work under constant time pressure — I need context, space to think, and constructive feedback to deliver meaningful results.

Currently, I’m applying data automation and modeling techniques to improve real-time economic data workflows, while continuously exploring how better data management leads to better decisions.

- 🌱 Studying DAMA’s DMBOK to earn DAMA certification  
- 👯 Open to collaborating on small AI-related projects for hands-on experience and continuous learning  
- 💬 Ask me anything — I might not have the answer, but I’ll enjoy exploring it with you  
- 📫 Reach me anytime (just remember, [no hello](https://nohello.net) 😉)  
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve been to the Bermuda Triangle a few times
