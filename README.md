### Hi there 👋

I’m Sebastian — I solve complex problems using data, algorithms, and a blend of technical expertise, puzzle-solving instincts, and intuition. Whether improving existing systems or developing new solutions, I approach every challenge with curiosity, creativity, and precision.

I thrive when learning new skills that align with my values and prefer solving problems through sustainable, well-founded practices rather than quick fixes. I don’t do my best work under constant time pressure — I need context, space to think, and constructive feedback to deliver meaningful results.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on enhancing the [PyCWT](https://github.com/regeirk/pycwt) in my free time.  
- 🌱 I’m studying DAMA’s DMBOK to become DAMA certified.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on small AI-related projects to gain hands-on experience and learn more.  
- 💬 Ask me anything — I might not have the answer, but I’d love to hear what’s on your mind.  
- 📫 How to reach me: Just send me a message, but remember, [no hello](https://nohello.net/en/) only. 
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve been to the Bermuda Triangle a few times.
