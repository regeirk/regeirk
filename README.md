## Hi there 👋

I am Sebastian and I solve complex problems using data, algorithms, and a combination of technical expertise, puzzle-solving skills and intuition. Whether improving existing systems or developing new solutions, I approach every challenge with curiosity, creativity, and precision.

I excel when learning new skills that align with my values and prefer solving problems with sustainable best practices rather than quick fixes. I struggle under extreme time pressure without room for reflection. To perform at my best, I need context, time to think, and constructive feedback.
